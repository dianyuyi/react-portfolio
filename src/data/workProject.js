      "給自行車紀錄里程數據，並上傳到官網雲端資料庫的APP。加入專案時，該APP需要增加新藍牙裝置使用的頁面，因此負責製作：腳踏車裝置選擇、心率介面、資料上傳清單等新UI。由於團隊後端成員居多，除負責大多數前端介面工作，也時常需要在會議上互相協調。專案後期發案方突然追加不在工作日程表上的離線資料庫需求，導致團隊和發案方有些衝突，最後在複數成員互相支援的情況下，在死線前成功提交功能。",

      "Record the mileage data of the bicycle and upload it to the APP of the official website cloud database. When joining the project, the APP needs to add a page for the new Bluetooth device, so I am responsible for making new UIs such as bicycle device selection, heart rate interface, and data upload list. Since most of the back-end team members are in the team, I am not only responsible for most of the front-end interface work, but also often need to coordinate with each other in meetings. In the later stage of the project, the issuer suddenly added an offline database requirement that was not on the work schedule, causing some conflicts between the team and the issuer. Finally, with multiple members supporting each other, the function was successfully submitted before the deadline.",
