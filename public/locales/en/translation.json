  "about_article_part1":"The university graduated from the Chinese Department. At the beginning, I was engaged in the editing of textbooks related to the undergraduate department. After I left due to health factors, I switched to the field of design because of my interest. At first, I accumulated work and experience in the way of SOHO, and later hoped to apply the design to a wider range of digital design, so I began to step into front-end web design by self-study.",
  "about_article_part2":"While studying front-end design, I have never given up the calligraphy studies that I cultivated since the college student club. But calligraphy is an ancient art that is gradually reaching its end. Therefore, trying to coexist digital art and traditional art often makes me struggle. It is now decided that both parties will stick to it and become a front-end developer with digital art as the main axis to try a variety of cross-domain creations."
