  "about_article_part1":"The university graduated from the Chinese Department. At the beginning, I was engaged in the editing of textbooks related to the undergraduate department. After I left due to health factors, I switched to the field of design because of my interest. At first, I accumulated work and experience in the way of SOHO, and later hoped to apply the design to a wider range of digital design, so I began to step into front-end web design by self-study.",
  "about_article_part2":"While studying front-end design, I also maintain the calligraphy interest that I have cultivated since the university community. Now I am working hard to become a front-end developer focusing on digital art, and try to create as many digital and traditional cross-domain creations as possible."
